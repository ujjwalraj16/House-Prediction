# House-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether the price of a house is above or below the median value based on various features such as  number of rooms, no of households to distance from water bodies. The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier and optimized with GridSearchCV.

Tools Used:
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy – data manipulation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization
* Scikit-learn – machine learning algorithms and tools
* GridSearchCV – hyperparameter tuning

Results:
Best Parameters: Obtained from GridSearchCV
Accuracy: ~85-90% (depending on data and parameters)

Data Source: Kaggle
